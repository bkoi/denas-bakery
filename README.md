## Project Goal

DeNa's Bakery has been created to provide an online shop for people who either cannot consume gluten free bakery products due to their gluten sensitivity, wheat allergy or coeliac disease, or they refrain from eating gluten as a part of their lifestyle choice. It promotes delicious, freshly-baked, savoury and sweet gluten-free bakery products made by using only quality ingredients. All the creations are made in a gluten-safe way so no cross-contamination can occur which makes these goodies safe and enjoyable even for customers with coeliac disease. Customers are offered the option to submit their orders online, alternatively, they can also pop into the shop to purchase some of the creations. By completing an online form, catering can be ordered for garden parties, barbeques or smaller events at home.

The intuitive navigation and the current features make the user experience seamless and enjoyable.

This project is for educational purposes only and has been created for the User-centric Front End Development module of Code Institute.

## User Experience (UX)

* ### User stories
    * #### First Time Visitor Goals
        1.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the profile of this online shop.
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily navigate the site and browse the products on offer.
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to view the menu, submit my order online and check how I can contact the seller.
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to check the company's social media presence and I expect that these links will open in separate tabs.
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to ensure that I can trust the gluten free nature of these products so I expect to see a disclaimer about this.

    * #### Returning Visitor Goals
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the products I usually order quickly, with their price displayed.
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to select the date of delivery for my order.
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to receive a confirmation once my order has been placed.
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the seller if I have any queries.

    * #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want the website to work well on tablet and mobile as I prefer submitting my orders on-the-go.

* ### Design
    * #### Color Scheme
        My final color palette was inspired by the one found on [Easil](https://about.easil.com/how-to-create-a-stunning-color-palette-with-just-an-image/) which has a considerably good contrast ratio.

        ![New Color Scheme](./assets/images/new-color-scheme.png)

        * #fccbc3: This bright and playful, baby pink background color provides a good contrast with black, which my previous choice, the earth-toned #59312a would not have provided. My choice of background color for the navigation bar emphasizes that eating bakery products can still be fun and without any pain, allergic reactions or suffering which are the symptoms of gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease.
        * #bd7f75: I decided to use this colour for the main part of the body element as it is a warmer shade, is in line with the concept of earthiness and looks well with black as the main text color.
        * #9ebfc9: To contrast the warmth of the #bd7f75, this cool, bright blue color was incorporated to bring a pop of color to the buttons and the footer.
        * #000000: After deciding not to use #59312a as my main text color, I cast my vote on black for a better contrast.
        * #9ebfc9 and #a06b73: These colours were used for my call-to-action buttons to provide an upbeat contrast with their backgound color or image. I used two different text colors, black on the blue buttons which change to white on a mauve button once being hovered over or clicked on.
    * ### Typography
        After trialling potential font styles on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), I decided to create my logo with the [Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Lobster) font as it looks playful and its handwritten nature give authenticity to my logo, brand and main headers. Out of the suggested pairings, [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster?query=Lobster#pairings) seemed to be the most suitable one to create the illusion of space and lightness on the website, I later added [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato#pairings) as an alterantive font style. 
    * ### Icons
        In order to create a simple, yet effective style, I only used a few icons from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library. I relied on them to make the website visually more appealing, for example, by using social media icons or a hamburger icon to make the UI design sleeker on mobile devices.
    * ### Structure
        I utilised [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) to create the overall structure of my website. As it includes useful elements of CSS styling and JavaScript, I could ensure that my page kept a good structure on all viewports, includes mobiles.

* ### Wireframes

    I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/docs/) when creating the wireframes for my website. I started with designing the layout of the desktop view, then moved onto creating my tablet wireframe, while keeping in mind what my website would look like on a mobile device before finalising its design on the wireframe. I redesigned my wireframes a couple of times until I was satisfied that there was not too much information crammed onto each page, they complied with the accessibility criteria, also with the pre-defined user stories, and the layout enabled a pleasant user experience. My final wireframes can be accessed below.

The webpage was extensively tested on various devices and browsers. Any bugs related to these are noted in the **Bugs** section.


### Bugs
#### Navigation
On the landing page, there used to be a heading saying "Where gluten free meets delicious!", but eventually I decided to remove this entirely from the website because it overflew the navigation links only on iPad-Pro and made the Home button unusable.
#### Home
My carousel did not slide on iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro which I managed to fix by resizing my hero images to be of the same height and width.
#### About
The card containing the picture had some white space underneath the image itself but only on iOS screens. By setting max-width, height, display block for the id of this picture, I managed to solve this problem as well.
#### Footer
My footer did not stay at the bottom of those pages which had a bit less content, e.g. Thank You  and Contact page which I fixed with flexbox by using the code snippet found on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/) and [DEV Community](https://dev.to/domysee/keeping-the-footer-at-the-bottom-with-css-flexbox-5h5f) also assisted sorting this out.

Another issue with the footer only occured when viewing the site on iPad-Pro. I managed to resolved this issue by using a fix recommended by a commentor on [Matt Smith's site](https://allthingssmitty.com/2020/05/11/css-fix-for-100vh-in-mobile-webkit/).
#### Menu
Even though I utilised Bootstrap cards to create the individual items on the Menu page, there was a white margin on the right hand side of each card so I resized all pictures to be of the same size, i.e. 640x428, which resolved this issue.

### Unfixed Bugs
#### Footer
On large screens my carousel images seem to overflow the footer which I tried to resolve by adding more padding to the div containing the slider images but I still have not been able to find the solution to this issue.
#### Carousel 
Even though I tried all the possible solutions proposed by other coders online as to how to make my carousel images cover the main section of the landing page on all screensizes, once the viewport is changed to a medium-sized or smaller device, there is some blank space between the footer and the bottom of the carousel image. It is another predominantly iOS bug.

## Credits

### Code

I took some code snippets from [MDN Web Docs moz://a](https://developer.mozilla.org/), from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), from [Quentin Watt Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGGGu_hp8ToQ9BR6Vni19w), from [CI tutorials](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/diplomainsoftwaredevelopment), from [Bootsnipp](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/VgVDB), from [OSTraining](https://www.ostraining.com/blog/coding/responsive-google-maps/).


### Content

The color scheme was inspired by [Easil](https://about.easil.com/how-to-create-a-stunning-color-palette-with-just-an-image/) to ensure better color contrast.

Some of the scripts used in the menu section can be found on [The Loopy Whisk](https://theloopywhisk.com/2020/04/02/ultimate-gluten-free-bread/), on [Immigrant's Table](https://immigrantstable.com/raspberry-mini-pavlovas/), on [Gluten Free on a Shoestring](https://glutenfreeonashoestring.com/gluten-free-carrot-cake-cupcakes/).

The structuring of my README.md file was majorly influenced by the sample provided by [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME/blob/master/README.md) and the README.md file created by a former student, [Anouk Smet](https://github.com/AnoukSmet/Naturazy#readme) whose work was recommended via Slack.

### Design

The design and content of [SugarDaddy's Bakery](https://www.youneedcake.co.uk/), [Bakery Nouveau](https://www.bakerynouveau.com/) and and a [Wix bakery template](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/1798) deeply influenced my design ideas when creating my website. 


### Media

The pictures on the website originate from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my Mentor for his helpful feedback, and also the Slack community who had dealt with the same issues that I encountered during the development of this project. It was tremendously useful to have access to their previous challenges and their solutions. 

### Remark
My GitHub repository got corrupted 1 week before the submission deadline so I was unable to push any more changes, gits onto it. Consequently, I had to create a brand new repository to copy all the code and images over, but I was not able to copy my git commits. Therefore, the git commits enlisted on this repository are not a true reflection of the number of gits and the actual time spent on this project.
